# Weather Report App

A simple, modern web application to get weather updates for selected cities in Nigeria.  
This project demonstrates **query strings**, **conditional responses**, and **JSON handling** using the `fs` module.

> âš¡ **Note:** No database was used. Weather data is predefined in a JSON file (`data/weather.json`) with more than 50 sample cities.

---

## Learning Objectives
By building this project, we practiced and demonstrated:

- Using query strings in Express routes  
- Handling conditional responses (valid city vs unknown city)  
- Reading and parsing JSON data with Nodeâ€™s built-in `fs` module  
- Structuring a Node.js/Express project using MVC(Model â€“ View â€“ Controller)-style modularity  
- Returning both JSON API responses and HTML frontend rendering  
- Graceful error handling and accessibility-friendly frontend design  
- Working effectively as a team with version control (Git/GitHub)  

---

## Features
- Get weather details by city name using a query string (`?city=...`)
- Returns both **JSON API responses** and an **HTML frontend page**
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, sunrise/sunset, and condition
- Handles **unknown cities** gracefully with a clear error message
- Simple, responsive, and user-friendly design
- Loading spinner for better UX
- Accessible and easy to use

---

## How It Works
- Weather data is stored in `weather.json`.  
- The backend reads the file using Nodeâ€™s built-in **fs module**.  
- A query like:

http://localhost:3000/weather?city=calabar

returns weather details for **Calabar**.  
If the city is not found, JSON or HTML shows `"City not found"`.
